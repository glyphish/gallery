Glyphish-Gallery
================

A simple app to browse your Glyphish icons and just drag and drop them straight into Xcode.

Clone the repository and build in Xcode. Put your Glyphish icons in a folder and point the app to that folder. Done.

The binary is included in the package if you don't want to build it yourself. Enjoy!
